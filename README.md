# NBA Predictive Statistics

This project will explore potential factors in basketball that correlate to more wins for a given team.  

## Overview

In this project, we will explore fcotrs x, y, and z, and study the relationship between these variables and the wins for a team. 

### Interesting Insight (Optional)

This is optional but highly recommended. You'll include one interesting insight from your project as part of the README. This insight is most effective when you include a visual. Keep in mind that this visual must be included as an image file (e.g., JPG, PNG, etc.). You can export plots created with `{ggplot2}` by using the function `ggsave`.
