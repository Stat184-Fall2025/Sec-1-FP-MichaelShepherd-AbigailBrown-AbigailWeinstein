FINAL PROJECT PLAN
Goal: Produce a report discussing relationships between various basketball 
stats and overall season performance

Task 1 - Code and Explore Data
Step 1: Collect data and clean data
  a. Download data from Basketball-Reference by season from 2015 to 2025
  b. Add year var. to each season
  c. Merge data via row bind. 
    **Note: be sure to exclude COVID season data**
  d. Clean data
  e. Generate win ratio and game total statistics
Step 2: Identify variables of interest
  a. Meet with team, discuss possible variables
  b. Create a subset containing these variables 
    **Note: vars selected: pace, age, and 3PA**
Step 3: Conduct exploratory data analysis on data 
  a. Develop summary tables for data addressing min., max., mean and other stats.
  b. Create a 10-year breakdown of stats by team
  c. Plot out trends in win rates over time
  d. Explore relationships with identified variables 
    i. Correlation coefficients + statistical significance
    ii. Line of best fit plots
Step 4: Identify impact of vars. on win rate
  a. Generate a linear regression model
  b. Create a table for the linear regression model
  c. Plot regression

Task 2: Create report/presentation - .QMD and .PDF
Step 1: Explain topic of interest + data
  a. Identify research goal (see above)
  b. Explain data sourcing 
  c. FAIR and CARE principles
  d. General data exploration 
    i. Use tables from EDA in 1.3.a & b
  e. Identify variables of interest
Step 2: Data exploration and analysis
  a. Discuss each variable's relevance to win ratio
  b. Explore individual relationships between variables and success
    **Note: use visualizations from 1.3.d
    i. Explain individual relationships and implications
  c. Synthesize relationships 
    **Note: use vis. from 1.4
    i. Explain regression model and implications
Step 3: Discussion 
  a. Identify findings
  b. Develop a collective narrative about the elements discussed
  c. Reflect
    **Note: identify areas of future exploration, limitations, etc. 

Task 3: Create GITHUB repository
Step 1: Open GitHub repository and share with team
  a. See instructions from Project_Guidelines document
Step 2: Add necessary documentation
  a. README.md
  b. Plan document
  c. Upload code, vis, data, and report
Step 3: Organize repo
  a. Create separate files for code, vis, and data
  b. Update README.md with appropriate hyperlinks
Step 4: Review report and repo
